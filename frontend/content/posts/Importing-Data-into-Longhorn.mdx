  Learn how to efficiently migrate data into Longhorn volumes on your Kubernetes
  cluster. This step-by-step guide covers exporting data from an existing
  container, creating a Persistent Volume Claim (PVC) in Longhorn, and importing
  the data using a simple Busybox pod. Perfect for homelab Kubernetes setups!

Recently, I deployed my Kubernetes cluster in my homelab and decided to use Longhorn as the storage provider. One question that came up was: How do I import my existing data into Longhorn volumes?

In this guide, I’ll walk you through the process of exporting data from an existing container, creating a Longhorn volume, and importing that data into the new volume. Let’s get started!

## Step 1: Export Data from an Existing Container or Volume

First, we need to export the data from the existing container.

* Open a Shell in the Running Container\
  Use `docker exec` to open a shell in the container you want to export data from:

```shell
sudo docker exec - it gitea / bin / sh
```

* Archive (Tar) the Data\
  Navigate to the directory where your data is stored and compress it into a tarball for easy copying:

```shell
/ # cd /data/
/data # ls
git           gitea         ssh
/data # tar -czf gitea.tar.gz .
```

* Copy the Tarball from the Container to Your Host\
  Exit the shell and use `docker cp` to copy the tarball to your host:

```shell
sudo docker cp gitea:/data/gitea.tar.gz .
Successfully copied 10.3MB to /home/remco/.
```

Now that we have exported the data, let's move on to creating the Longhorn volume where we will import this data.

## Step 2: Create a Volume on Longhorn

There are different ways to create a volume in Longhorn. For simplicity, we'll use the Longhorn UI to create a Persistent Volume Claim (PVC).

* Create a Persistent Volume Claim (PVC)

* After creating the PVC via the Longhorn UI, you can verify its existence in the desired Kubernetes namespace:

```shell
$ kubectl get pvc -n gitea
NAME         STATUS   VOLUME       CAPACITY   ACCESS MODES   STORAGECLASS      AGE
gitea-data   Bound    gitea-data   10Gi       RWO            longhorn-static   22s
```

* Once the PVC is bound, you're ready to import the data into the Longhorn volume.

## Step 3: Create a Pod to Import the Data

To copy the data to the Longhorn volume, we’ll need a pod that can mount the volume. For this example, we’ll use a simple [busybox](https://hub.docker.com/_/busybox "busybox") pod, but you can use any container you prefer.

* Create a Busybox Pod\
  Below is a YAML file to create a busybox pod that will sleep for an hour, giving us time to copy and extract the data.

```yaml
---
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: busybox
  labels:
    app: busybox
spec:
  containers:
    - image: busybox
      name: busybox
      command:
        - sleep
        - "3600"
      volumeMounts:
        - name: data
          mountPath: "/data"
  volumes:
    - name: data
      persistentVolumeClaim:
        claimName: gitea-data

```

* Apply the YAML file using kubectl:

```shell
kubectl apply -f busybox.yaml -n gitea
```

### Verify the Pod is Running

* Check that the pod is up and running with the following command:

```shell
$ kubectl get pods -n gitea
NAME                     READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
busybox                  1/1     Running   0          70s
gitea-5df8b6db65-6fkc8   1/1     Running   0          25m
```

Now that the pod is running, we can proceed with copying the data.

## Step 4: Copy the Tar File into the Pod

* Use the `kubectl cp` command to copy the tar file into the **busybox** pod, specifically to the **/data** directory:

```shell
$ kubectl cp - n gitea./ gitea.tar.gz busybox: /data/
```

### Extract the Tar File in the Pod

* Next, we’ll open a shell in the busybox pod and extract the tar file:

```shell
kubectl exec - n gitea--stdin--tty busybox-- / bin / sh
/ # cd / data
/ data # ls
gitea.tar.gz  lost + found
/ data # tar - xzf gitea.tar.gz
/ data # ls
git           gitea         gitea.tar.gz  lost + found  ssh

```

* After verifying the data is extracted correctly, you can remove the tar file to clean up:

```shell
$ kubectl delete -f busybox.yaml - n gitea
```

## Step 5: Clean Up

* Once the data is successfully imported, delete the busybox pod to free up resources. If you used the provided YAML file, simply run:

```shell
$ kubectl delete -f busybox.yaml - n gitea
```

## That's It!

You’ve now imported your existing data into a Longhorn volume. You can deploy your applications and attach the Longhorn volume as needed.

With this approach, you can easily migrate your data from old containers or volumes to new Longhorn-backed PVCs in your Kubernetes cluster.

Feel free to customize this process depending on your setup. Longhorn makes managing persistent storage in Kubernetes seamless, even in homelabs!
