Introduction:
In a previous [blog post](/ai/agentgpt-the-next-gen-chatgpt), I have already written about the amazing capabilities of AgentGPT. Unfortunately, currently running 10 agents every 3 hours is not feasible due to the high costs for the creators of AgentGPT. Fortunately, there is a solution: you can host AgentGPT yourself! On [this Github repo](https://github.com/reworkd/AgentGPT) you will find further instructions about the build process.

But since dockerizing an application and then hosting it in the cloud can be quite a challenge if you're not familiar with Docker, I've already done this work for you. On Dockerhub you can find the [AgentGPT images in my repo](https://hub.docker.com/search?q=kerstenremco%2Fagentgpt).

In this blog post, I will explain how to dockerize AgentGPT and then host it on Linode, a cloud provider with Kubernetes support.

<Alert text="Linode is a cloud provider known for its reliable and high-performance hosting solutions. You can create an account yourself to follow the steps below." type="info" />

## Steps to Host AgentGPT on Linode

* Create a Kubernetes instance on Linode. For this demo, one worker is sufficient, but for production
  environments, it is recommended to use at least 3 workers. Ensure that the worker has a minimum of **4 CPUs** and **8 GB
  of memory** to guarantee optimal performance.\

* **Download the YAML file** containing the configuration for the Kubernetes environment. Go to the **Kubernetes
  Dashboard** on Linode and log in by uploading the YAML file.\
  ![](/images/post-images/hosting-agentgpt/hosting-agentgpt-on-linode-2.png)
* Create a Load Balancer. The Load Balancer ensures that the container we will implement in the next
  step is publicly accessible. Click on the **+ symbol** in the top right corner and **upload the following YAML** file to
  the Linode Kubernetes Dashboard to create the Load Balancer.

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: agentgpt
spec:
  selector:
    app: agentgpt
  ports:
    - port: 80
      targetPort: 3000
  type: LoadBalancer
```

Once the Load Balancer is created, you can you find the URL where Agent GPT can be accessed later.\

* Deploy the 3 containers (pods) within Kubernetes by uploading the following YAML file to the Linode
  Kubernetes Dashboard.
* Replace the **\<base>** variable with a [random base64 string ](https://generate.plus/en/base64)
* Replace the 2 **\<url>** variables with the URL of your load balancer (previous step)

```yaml
  apiVersion: apps/v1
  kind: Deployment
  metadata:
    name: agentgpt
    labels:
      app: agentgpt
  spec:
    selector:

              - name: DATABASE_URL
                value: "file:../db/db.sqlite"
          - name: agentgpt-platform
            image: kerstenremco/agentgpt-platform
            resources:
                limits:
                  memory: "4096Mi"
                  cpu: "1"
            ports:
              - containerPort: 8000
          - name: agentgpt-db

            resources:
                limits:
                  memory: "1024Mi"
                  cpu: "1"
            ports:
            command: ["/bin/bash", "-c", "mysqld --initialize && mysqld --character-set-server=utf8mb4 --collation-server=utf8mb4_unicode_ci"]
            ports:
              - containerPort: 3306
            env:
              - name: MYSQL_DATABASE
                value: reworkd_platform
              - name: MYSQL_USERNAME
                value: reworkd_platform
              - name: MYSQL_PASSWORD
                value: reworkd_platform
              - name: MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD
                value: reworkd_platform
```

Wait for a few minutes and check under **Pods** to see if the pod has a status of **running**.

* **Now, open the URL of your Load Balancer**, and voila, you have your own AgentGPT at your disposal!![](/images/post-images/hosting-agentgpt/hosting-agentgpt-on-linode-5.png)

## Conclusion

Using Kubernetes on Linode, you can easily host your own instance of AgentGPT. Have fun exploring the capabilities of AgentGPT in your self-hosted environment! ðŸ˜Š
