These days, security becomes more critical by the hour. While there’s no shortage of security products out there, many come with a hefty price tag.

At the same time, open source is becoming increasingly important—especially when it comes to digital sovereignty. So, I decided to put this to the test and build a simple SOC/SIEM stack at home using only open-source tools.

Here’s what the stack consists of:

1. **Wazuh** – SIEM platform
2. **MISP** – Threat intelligence platform
3. **Cortex** – SOAR tool focused on analyzing IOCs across various sources
4. **Shuffle** – SOAR automation platform

For this setup, I wanted to analyze outbound traffic from my Fortigate firewall. The data flow looks like this:

1. MISP collects IOCs from various sources
2. Wazuh imports those IOCs into its internal database
3. Every outbound connection from the Fortigate is logged to Wazuh
4. If there’s a match with a known IOC, Wazuh forwards the alert to Shuffle
5. Shuffle queries Cortex to determine if it's a true positive
6. Finally, I get a notification on Discord

Here’s a quick diagram of the setup:

Curious how I put it all together? Let’s dive in.

## MISP – Threat Feeds

In MISP, I enabled several feeds including CIRCL, Botvrij, and Abuse.ch. These feeds pull in events with IOCs:

## Wazuh CDB – Importing IOCs

To keep things performant, I decided to periodically import IOCs from MISP events into a Wazuh CDB list. I wrote a small Python script to extract IPs from MISP and write them to `/var/ossec/etc/lists`.

```python
#!/usr/bin/python3

from pymisp import ExpandedPyMISP
import re
import os

MISP_URL = 'https://misp'
MISP_KEY = 'xxxx'
VERIFY_CERT = False
OUTPUT_FILE = '/var/ossec/etc/lists/misp_ips'

print("Starting MISP IP import...")
misp = ExpandedPyMISP(MISP_URL, MISP_KEY, VERIFY_CERT)
result = misp.search(controller='attributes', type_attribute='ip-dst')

print(
    f"Found {len(result['Attribute'])} attributes in MISP, writing to {OUTPUT_FILE}...")
with open(OUTPUT_FILE, 'w') as f:
    pattern = r"^\d{1,3}\.\d{1,3}\.\d{1,3}\.\d{1,3}$"
    f.seek(0)
    f.truncate()
    for attr in result['Attribute']:
        if re.match(pattern, attr['value']):
            value = attr['value']
            f.write(f'{value}:misp\n')

print("Restarting Wazuh manager...")
os.system("systemctl restart wazuh-manager")

print("MISP IP import completed successfully.")

```

Once the list is updated, restarting the Wazuh manager triggers the creation of a new lookup database.

## Forwarding Fortigate Logs to Wazuh

To get syslog data from Fortigate into Wazuh, I added the following configuration in the Wazuh manager:

![](/images/post-images/socsiemlab/wazusyslog.png)

```xml
<remote>
  <connection>syslog</connection>
  <port>514</port>
  <protocol>udp</protocol>
  <allowed-ips>10.59.0.0/16</allowed-ips>
</remote>
```

Then, I configured my Fortigate to send logs to the Wazuh manager:

Wazuh comes with built-in decoders for Fortigate logs, which worked well out of the box. For traffic events, the rule with ID **81618** was triggered.

I added a custom rule to match outbound traffic where the destination IP appears in the CDB list. If there’s a hit, Wazuh triggers a new alert with ID **100010**:

![](/images/post-images/socsiemlab/wazuhfortigaterule.png)

```xml
<rule id="100010" level="12">
  <if_sid>81618</if_sid>
  <list field="dstip" lookup="address_match_key">etc/lists/misp_ips</list>
  <description>Outgoing traffic seen on Fortigate to known bad IP</description>
</rule>
```

## Cortex – IOC Enrichment

In Cortex, I enabled the AbuseIPDB analyzer. Of course, Cortex is most useful when combining multiple analyzers, but for this proof-of-concept, one is enough to demonstrate the workflow.

## Shuffle – Automation Workflow

I created a Shuffle workflow triggered by a webhook. The steps look like this:

1. **IP Lookup** - The destination IP is passed to Cortex, which checks the AbuseIPDB analyzer for enrichment.
2. **Wait & Fetch Result** - Since Cortex may take a few seconds to respond, the workflow waits 10 seconds before checking the result.
3. **Query MISP (if needed)** - If the IP is flagged as malicious, Shuffle checks MISP to see which event it came from.
4. **Discord Notification** - A message is sent to Discord with the details.

## Wazuh Integration with Shuffle

To trigger the Shuffle workflow when a Wazuh rule hits, I added the following integration config to Wazuh:

![](/images/post-images/socsiemlab/wazuhshufflerint.png)

```xml
<integration>
  <name>shuffle</name>
  <hook_url>https://shuffle.internal.remcokersten.nl/api/v1/hooks/webhook_9195d1d8-43d5-4090-b080-4c3f57a01242</hook_url>
  <rule_id>100010</rule_id>
  <alert_format>json</alert_format>
</integration>
```

## Final Thoughts

With just a few open-source tools, it’s entirely possible to build a functional SOC/SIEM environment at home. While this setup is still a work in progress, it already provides valuable insights and hands-on experience in threat detection and response.

This kind of stack is ideal for learning, experimenting, and developing a deeper understanding of security operations—all without breaking the bank.
