Dentibot is an AI chatbot designed to help users analyze, explain, and answer questions about dental invoices with ease and accuracy.

Dentibot leverages the capabilities of Anthropic Claude as its language model, integrated via AWS Bedrock. Knowledge base is trained on the current information of KNMT, which is stored in a Pinecone vectordatabase.

Both the frontend and backend are fully serverless, ensuring scalability and reliability. The entire infrastructure is deployed using AWS CloudFormation.
